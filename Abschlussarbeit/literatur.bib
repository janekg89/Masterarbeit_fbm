abstract = {Conventional equations for enzyme kinetics are based on mass-action laws, that may fail in low-dimensional and disordered media such as biological membranes. We present Monte Carlo simulations of an isolated Michaelis-Menten enzyme reaction on two-dimensional lattices with varying obstacle densities, as models of biological membranes. The model predicts that, as a result of anomalous diffusion on these low-dimensional media, the kinetics are of the fractal type. Consequently, the conventional equations for enzyme kinetics fail to describe the reaction. In particular, we show that the quasi-stationary-state assumption can hardly be retained in these conditions. Moreover, the fractal characteristics of the kinetics are increasingly pronounced as obstacle density and initial substrate concentration increase. The simulations indicate that these two influences are mainly additive. Finally, the simulations show pronounced S-P segregation over the lattice at obstacle densities compatible with in vivo conditions. This phenomenon could be a source of spatial self organization in biological membranes.},

@phdthesis{Johannesschoneberg2014,
abstract = {We can see the faintest stars because rod cells in our eyes can detect single photons reliably and convert them reproducibly into an output current. Visual rhodopsin molecules respond to photon absorption by a change of their shape that sends a signal to other proteins. But how does this signal transduction cascade proceed in detail? How are the individual copies of all involved proteins orchestrated in space and time to give rise to cellular output? Experiments cannot simultaneously probe localizations and time sequences of all relevant molecular processes. A solution is to inte- grate experimental data in physically realistic computer models and simulating the spatiotemporal mechanism of signal transduction. The most detailed reaction kinetics simulation techniques are particle- based reaction-diffusion (PBRD) simulations. Here all molecules are represented as individual particles. Their diffusive motion and the reactions between them are simulated explicitly in space and time. However, existing PBRD techniques lack interaction potentials between particles that are needed to realistically model molecular aggregates, clusters or fibers/chains. Here a new class of reaction kinetics models is introduced that combines PBRD with interaction potentials. ReaDDy, a generic and platform-independent software package, has been developed to imple- ment this new class. ReaDDy has a modular and extensible software design, enabling straightforward implementations for different hard- ware (e.g. single-CPU, multithreading, GPU), and the incorporation of different models of particle dynamics (e.g. Langevin, overdamped Langevin, Metropolis Monte Carlo). Arbitrary particle interaction potentials (e.g. space exclusion, electrostatic interaction), and var- ious cellular geometries (e.g. disc membranes or vesicles) can be user-defined. ReaDDy was used to shed light on the spatiotemporal details of photoactivation in rod cell disc membranes. While the supramolecular architecture of rhodopsin (R) is controversial, it was shown here that various R-architectures are consistent with kinetic activation experi- ments performed by our experimental collaborators at Charit{\'{e}} (Berlin). Important mechanistic insights were produced, including: (1) The rate- limiting molecular steps in G-protein activation were identified. (2) Unproductive complexes between inactive R and G may exist, but their lifetime is limited to the 100 microseconds timescale. (3) Supramolecular structures of R (as opposed to uniformly distributed individual Rs) do not increase the speed of the activation kinetics. Such structures are likely to play an other regulatory role in the cascade. Simultaneously, experimentalists at Caesar (Bonn) have found new evidence of a specific and regular supramolecular structure, in which rhodopsin forms ’tracks’, i.e. double rows of dimers of approximately uniform length. A ReaDDy model confirms that this architecture is consistent with kinetic measurements, but also reveals a new regula- tion mechanism: The spatially separate and uniform track structures of R, combined with short-lived inactive R-G-precomplexes of R and G, lead to a time-scale separation of fast intra-track diffusion and activation and slow inter-track diffusion. As a result, the G-activation kinetics is biphasic, with a quick activation burst of {\~{}}4 G-proteins associated to one track. The subsequent slow activation phase is insensitive to the exact shutoff time of rhodopsin, thus ensuring a reliable output. While this insight from simulations must be confirmed experimentally, it may be an important component of single-photon response uniformity. The concepts and software developed in this thesis are not limited to rod cell phototransduction, but represent a general contribution towards a new generation of quantitative biology using physically real- istic models. In the future, together with super-resolution microscopy and single-molecule experiments, they could provide the foundation to reach for the stars in ’cellular dynamics’: Being able to simulate an entire cell.},

abstract = {Brownian motion has played important roles in many different fields of science since its origin was first explained by Albert Einstein in 1905. Einstein's theory of Brownian motion, however, is only applicable at long time scales. At short time scales, Brownian motion of a suspended particle is not completely random, due to the inertia of the particle and the surrounding fluid. Moreover, the thermal force exerted on a particle suspended in a liquid is not a white noise, but is colored. Recent experimental developments in optical trapping and detection have made this new regime of Brownian motion accessible. This review summarizes related theories and recent experiments on Brownian motion at short time scales, with a focus on the measurement of the instantaneous velocity of a Brownian particle in a gas and the observation of the transition from ballistic to diffusive Brownian motion in a liquid.},

Background interactions may be either repulsive, leading to preferential size-and-shape-dependent exclusion from highly volume-occupied elements of volume, or attractive, leading to nonspecific associations or adsorption. Nonspecific interactions with different constituents of the cellular interior lead to three classes of phenomena: macromolecular crowding, confinement and adsorption. Theory and experiment have established that predominantly repulsive background interactions tend to enhance the rate and extent of macromolecular associations in solution, whereas predominantly attractive background interactions tend to enhance the tendency of macromolecules to associate on adsorbing surfaces. Greater than order-of-magnitude increases in association rate and equilibrium constants attributable to background interactions have been observed in simulated and actual intracellular environments.},

The resulting non-Markovian equation can be interpreted in a natural way as the evolution equation of the marginal density function of a random time process l (t). We then consider the subordinated process Y (t) = X (l (t)) where X (t) is a Markovian diffusion. The corresponding time evolution of the marginal density function of Y (t) is governed by a non-Markovian Fokker-Planck equation which involves the memory kernel K (t). We develop several applications and derive the exact solutions. We consider different stochastic models for the given equations providing path simulations. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We develop the stochastic, chemical master equation as a unifying approach to the dynamics of biochemical reaction systems in a mesoscopic volume under a living environment. A living environment provides a continuous chemical energy input that sustains the reaction system in a nonequilibrium steady state with concentration fluctuations. We discuss the linear, unimolecular single-molecule enzyme kinetics, phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle (PdPC) with bistability, and network exhibiting oscillations. Emphasis is paid to the comparison between the stochastic dynamics and the prediction based on the traditional approach based on the Law of Mass Action. We introduce the difference between nonlinear bistability and stochastic bistability, the latter has no deterministic counterpart. For systems with nonlinear bistability, there are three different time scales: (a) individual biochemical reactions, (b) nonlinear network dynamics approaching to attractors, and (c) cellular evolution. For mesoscopic systems with size of a living cell, dynamics in (a) and (c) are stochastic while that with (b) is dominantly deterministic. Both (b) and (c) are emergent properties of a dynamic biochemical network; We suggest that the (c) is most relevant to major cellular biochemical processes such as epi-genetic regulation, apoptosis, and cancer immunoediting. The cellular evolution proceeds with transitions among the attractors of (b) in a "punctuated equilibrium" manner.},

Z. 49, 333-369] in which they showed that the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is proportional to the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex predicted by the Michaelis-Menten equation. Because the original text was written in German yet is often quoted by English-speaking authors, we undertook a complete translation of the 1913 publication, which we provide as Supporting Information . Here we introduce the translation, describe the historical context of the work, and show a new analysis of the original data. In doing so, we uncovered several surprises that reveal an interesting glimpse into the early history of enzymology. In particular, our reanalysis of Michaelis and Menten's data using modern computational methods revealed an unanticipated rigor and precision in the original publication and uncovered a sophisticated, comprehensive analysis that has been overlooked in the century since their work was published. Michaelis and Menten not only analyzed initial velocity measurements but also fit their full time course data to the integrated form of the rate equations, including product inhibition, and derived a single global constant to represent all of their data. That constant was not the Michaelis constant, but rather V(max)/K(m), the specificity constant times the enzyme concentration (k(cat)/K(m) × E(0)).},

abstract="Infrared focal-plane arrays suffer from a type of 1/f noise which leads to slow drifts in detected radiation levels following calibration. This noise can be modeled by fractional Brownian motion (FBM), with an empirical Hurst parameter (H) in the range 0 < H < 1 / 2. For such noise we examine the statistics of both the maximum deviation from the calibration point during a fixed time, and the time to reach a fixed deviation from the calibration point. We employ analytical and numerical means; for the latter, we provide a new algorithm for generating a discrete-time version of FBM with 0 < H ≤ 1 / 2 which is fast (order N log N), and exact. Statistics of the maximum deviation show the same qualitative behavior for different values of H, and rapidly approach a limit as the length N increases. Results for first passage times, in contrast, vary markedly with H, but not with N.",

abstract= " Based on the theory of spectral estimation we propose a new algorithm that is capable to produce the whole variety of possible non deterministic linear time series which exhibit a (1/f)β spectrum. The key point of the new algorithm is to randomize both the phase and the amplitude of the Fourier transform of the data according to its stochastic nature. One possible application is the simulation of AGN lightcurves as well to analyze measured data as to test proposed models. "

    abstract = {We introduce the software package ReaDDy for simulation of detailed spatiotemporal mechanisms of dynamical processes in the cell, based on reaction-diffusion dynamics with particle resolution. In contrast to other particle-based reaction kinetics programs, ReaDDy supports particle interaction potentials. This permits effects such as space exclusion, molecular crowding and aggregation to be modeled. The biomolecules simulated can be represented as a sphere, or as a more complex geometry such as a domain structure or polymer chain. ReaDDy bridges the gap between small-scale but highly detailed molecular dynamics or Brownian dynamics simulations and large-scale but little-detailed reaction kinetics simulations. ReaDDy has a modular design that enables the exchange of the computing core by efficient platform-specific implementations or dynamical models that are different from Brownian dynamics.},
